    <p>I’m a researcher working at the intersection of <b>hydrogen technologies</b>, <b>materials science</b>, and <b>data science</b>. I study how nanoscale structure controls catalyst performance and stability, and I enjoy translating complex results into a more accessible language. I work at the Laboratory for Electrocatalysis at the National Institute of Chemistry in Ljubljana, Slovenia. <br><br>The main motivation behind my research is driving the progress of technologies that can benefit our society long-term. When not researching, I recharge by climbing, traveling, and learning foreign languages. If any of that resonates, please explore my page and get in touch (see below)!</p>

## Past experience 
Before my Ph.D., I had a bunch of student jobs and projects. Here are some of them:
 - I was a science communicator at a science center, Hiša eksperimentov, where I explained do-it-yourself experiments to visitors, led workshops, and developed new experiments for a traveling science exhibition.
 - I joined an international program, Pioneers into Practice by EIT Climate-KIC. It included a work placement at a start-up company, PowerUp Fuel Cells OÜ, in Tallinn, Estonia, as well as project work on wastewater treatment, and several innovation workshops.
 - I participated in a start-up accelerator with ReCatalyst (who later won the Slovenian start-up of the year award), organized by EIT RawMaterials.
 - I developed machine learning algorithms for tumor tissue recognition on images of eye melanoma as part of a project at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.
 - I was an astronomy tutor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, and I led observations with small telescopes for groups of Physics students.
