    Science and technology are fascinating, but they're often locked behind jargon and technical details. I believe in making them accessible and impactful through science communication, data visualization, and engaging digital content. I've worked in [academic research]({{ "/research/"   relative_url }}) and [public engagement]({{ "/scicomm/"   relative_url }}), and this site shares some of that work.
    Interested in collaborating? [Get in touch!]({{ "/about/"   relative_url }})
