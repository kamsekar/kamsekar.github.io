Welcome! I am a researcher in the Laboratory for Electrocatalysis at the National Institute of Chemistry in Ljubljana, Slovenia. 

I research materials for hydrogen and other clean technologies. I like turning lab results into clear visuals and explainers. This site shares my academic work and other activities.
