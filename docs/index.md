    <p>Science and technology are fascinating, but they're often locked behind jargon and technical details. I believe in making them accessible and impactful through science communication, data visualization, and engaging digital content. I've worked in       <a href="{{ "/research/" | relative_url }}">academic research</a> and <a href="{{ "/scicomm/" | relative_url }}">public engagement</a>, and this site shares some of that work.</p>
