Science communication is, in a very broad sense, the practice of sharing scientific knowledge with audiences beyond the expert community. It explains and critically evaluates science, and as such, bridges the gap between research and public understanding. 

I contribute to this effort by writing articles, sharing insights on social media, and giving occasional talks that make scientific topics more approachable and engaging.

Simon Čopar and I wrote an article on the phenomenon of spotted snow for Presek, a popular science journal (in Slovene).

The following two articles were published in Matrika, an online journal that presents engaging topics in physics and mathematics for a broad science audience. The first is a piece on transmission electron microscopy and its use in materials science, and the second (in Slovene) presents ionization of matter with light and examples of its application in biomedicine.
