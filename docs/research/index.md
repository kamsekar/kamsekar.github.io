My research focuses on **nanostructured electrocatalysts** for sustainable energy conversion, particularly in **proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers** and **fuel cells**.

    <p>These devices rely on catalysts based on precious metals such as <b>platinum</b> (Pt) and <b>iridium</b> (Ir), whose scarcity and cost drive the need for more efficient, durable, and resource-lean designs.</p>
    <p>I investigate the <b>structureâ€“property relationships</b> of Pt- and Ir-based nanoparticle catalysts on high-surface-area supports.</p>
    <p>Atomic-scale structure has a profound impact on catalytic activity and stability. Understanding it is essential for designing catalysts that meet industrial performance and lifetime requirements.</p>

    <p>A significant part of my work involves <b>automated image and diffraction pattern analysis</b> to extract quantitative insights from large datasets.</p>
    <p>I work with experts to combine <b>advanced electron microscopy</b>, including identical-location and 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (IL-STEM, 4D-STEM), with <b>X-ray diffraction (XRD)</b> and <b>electrochemical testing</b> (TF-RDE, modified floating electrode).</p>
    <p>By uniting <b>materials</b> and <b>data science</b>, my research aims to provide a bottom-up understanding of catalyst performance and degradation, enabling the rational design of next-generation electrocatalysts for a sustainable hydrogen economy.</p>
