My research focuses on **nanostructured electrocatalysts** for sustainable energy conversion, particularly in **proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers** and **fuel cells**. These devices rely on catalysts based on precious metals such as **platinum** (Pt) and **iridium** (Ir), whose scarcity and cost drive the need for more efficient, durable, and resource-lean designs.

I investigate the **structure–property relationships** of Pt- and Ir-based nanoparticle catalysts on high-surface-area supports. Atomic-scale structural features – including **alloy ordering**, **planar defects**, **degradation mechanisms**, and **metal–support interactions** – have a profound impact on catalytic activity and stability. Understanding these features is essential for designing catalysts that meet industrial performance and lifetime requirements.

## Methods

A significant part of my work involves **automated image and diffraction pattern analysis**, integrating data science and numerical simulations to extract quantitative insights from large datasets.
I work with experts to combine **advanced electron microscopy**, including identical-location and 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (IL-STEM, 4D-STEM), with **X-ray diffraction (XRD)** and **electrochemical testing** (TF-RDE, modified floating electrode).

By uniting **materials** and **data science**, my research aims to provide a bottom-up understanding of catalyst performance and degradation, enabling the rational design of next-generation electrocatalysts for a sustainable hydrogen economy.
